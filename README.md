## WASM vs JS Pitch detector

Simple project to compare WebAssembly performance improvement using MPM algorithm by Phillip McLeod.
Most of the code is rewrite from [TarsosDSP implementation](https://github.com/JorenSix/TarsosDSP/blob/master/src/core/be/tarsos/dsp/pitch/McLeodPitchMethod.java) which is based on [Tartini](https://github.com/Guildenstern/Tartini)
